## 🛠️ Development Setup
To develop and test the contract, we use the following tools:

### **1️⃣ Remix IDE**
Remix is a browser-based IDE for writing and deploying smart contracts.
- Open **[Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)**
- Create a new Solidity file and paste the contract code.
- Compile and deploy using an **Injected Provider (MetaMask)**.

### **2️⃣ Ganache**
Ganache is a local Ethereum blockchain simulator for testing.
- Download and install **[Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)**.
- Create a new workspace and start the local blockchain.
- Connect MetaMask to **localhost:7545** (Ganache's default network).

### **3️⃣ MetaMask**
MetaMask is a browser extension that acts as an Ethereum wallet.
- Install **[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)** and create an account.
- Import one of the accounts from **Ganache** using the private key.
- Use **Injected Web3** in Remix to deploy the contract to your local blockchain.

## 🚀 Deployment Guide
1. **Start Ganache** and connect MetaMask to it.
2. **Open Remix** and paste the GCToken contract code.
3. Compile the contract using **Solidity v0.8.x**.
4. Deploy using **Injected Web3** (MetaMask connected to Ganache).
5. Interact with the contract via Remix or develop a frontend for community engagement.

## 🏆 Contribution & Future Plans
We plan to:
- Implement a **Web3 frontend** for easier interaction.
- Introduce **limited edition NFTs** based on users’ participation.
- Expand the **$GCT token utility** to allow staking and exclusive benefits.
